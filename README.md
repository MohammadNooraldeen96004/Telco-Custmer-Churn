 🔬 Research Title

 Decoding Customer Churn: A Feature Importance Analysis Using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest

About the project

 This research aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using three machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

We focused on analyzing the importance of variables to identify the real reasons behind customer departures, and propose practical strategies to help telecom companies better retain their customers.

🎯 Key findings:

Monthly contracts and e-payment method were the most important factors influencing the decision to leave.

The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy (82%).

The Random Forest model provided an excellent balance between precision and recall.

📈 Project Impact:

 We succeeded in linking technical analysis and statistical models with practical decision-making to develop effective customer retention strategies.
